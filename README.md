# colourExtractor
Program that takes an image and calculates the colours within the image

This takes in an image and then finds the optimal part of a loss function from a cluster analysis 
to get the best number of colours that make up the image. 

The program then gives back the colours on the image in little circles and provides the hex
numbers on a coloured square for each of the colours.
